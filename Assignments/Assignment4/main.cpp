/*
The following operations are typically performed on a binary search tree:
1. Determine whether the binary tree is empty.
2. Search the binary search tree for a particular item
3. Insert an item in the binary search tree.
4. Delete an item from the binary search tree.
5. Find the height of the binary search tree.
6. Find the number of nodes in the binary search tree.
7. Find the number of leaves in the binary search tree.
8. Traverse the binary search tree (3).
9. Copy the binary search tree.


1- Load your tree with data - generate 100,000 long int in the range of 100 to
100,000,000 and insert in the tree, use cstdlib rand() function â€“ use last 4 digit
of your 700 number as seed.
2- Output the data in order to a data file, name to be passed in as command line
argument at run time. Format 3 to 5 numbers per line tab separated.
3- Test all 11 functions in the tree as defined above and as specified below.
4- Output each of the 11 tests in a clear section to the file, output the tree
height to the file.
5- Output the run time from start to finish in minutes, seconds and milliseconds to
the file (you can use ctime or chrono).
6- No user interactions I/O nothing on the display.
7- You may (probably need to) if you wish add 2 functions to your driver to update
and print values passed by reference or use any other mechanism to make
your code carry out the tasks specified above.
